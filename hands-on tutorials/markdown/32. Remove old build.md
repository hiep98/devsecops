# Remove old build



Delete old build in linux

```
sudo find /  -type d -name "builds"
 
/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/devsecops-app-num/builds
 
rm -r {1..100}
```

Reload config in jenkins dashboard





Jenkins script remove all build, just keep build 19,23

```
def jobName = "devsecops-app-num"  
def job = Jenkins.instance.getItem(jobName)  
job.getBuilds().each { 
    if (it.number != 19 && it.number != 23) {
        it.delete() 
    }
}  
job.nextBuildNumber = 1   
job.save()
```





You can optimize the if statement by using a list of build numbers that you want to keep and checking if the current build number is in that list. Here's how you can do it:



```
def jobName = "copy_folder"  
def job = Jenkins.instance.getItem(jobName)  
 
// List of build numbers to keep
def buildsToKeep = [19, 23, 25, 30, 33, 50]
 
job.getBuilds().each { 
    if (!buildsToKeep.contains(it.number)) {
        it.delete() 
    }
}  
job.nextBuildNumber = 1   
job.save() 
```



This script will delete all builds except for the ones with build numbers in the `buildsToKeep` list.
