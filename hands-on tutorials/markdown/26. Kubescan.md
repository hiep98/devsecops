# Kubescan
Kubescan scans Kubernetes cluster objects such as deployments, services, pods, and secrets for security risks and vulnerabilities, and provides a comprehensive report of identified risks based on their level of severity.  It can detect misconfigured RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) settings, privileged containers, exposed services, and other issues that could compromise your cluster security. This allows security teams to detect security issues in the Kubernetes environment during development, deployment and runtime, and provides actionable recommendations to remediate the risks  
  
Kube-Scan gives a risk score, from 0 (no risk) to 10 (high risk) for each workload. The risk is based on the runtime configuration of each workload (currently 20+ settings). The exact rules and scoring formula are part of the open-source framework KCCSS, the Kubernetes Common Configuration Scoring System.  
  
KCCSS is similar to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), the industry-standard for rating vulnerabilities, but instead focuses on the configurations and security settings themselves. Vulnerabilities are always detrimental, but configuration settings can be insecure, neutral, or critical for protection or remediation. KCCSS scores both risks and remediations as separate rules, and allows users to calculate a risk for every runtime setting of a workload and then to calculate the total risk of the workload.

kubectl port-forward --namespace kube-scan svc/kube-scan-ui 8081:80
``` 
  
  
  
Go to dashboard and we can see RISK and REMEDIATION
